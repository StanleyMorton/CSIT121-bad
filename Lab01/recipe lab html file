  <h1>Spam musubi Recipe</h1>
  <h2>Erica Walker</h2>
  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>4 cups of cooked and seasoned sushi rice</li>
    <li>8 sheets of nori (seaweed)</li>
    <li>8 slices of Spam</li>
    <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
    <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
    <li>1/4 cup mirin (Japanese rice wine)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon sesame seeds (optional)</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Instructions:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>In a small saucepan, combine soy sauce, sugar, and mirin. Heat over medium heat until the sugar is dissolved. Remove from heat and let it cool.</li>
    <li>Cut each slice of Spam into 4 pieces. In a skillet, cook the Spam until crispy on both sides.</li>
    <li>Place a piece of plastic wrap on a sushi rolling mat. Lay a sheet of nori, shiny side down, on the plastic wrap.</li>
    <li>Wet your hands and grab a handful of sushi rice. Press the rice evenly onto the nori, leaving about 1 inch of nori at the top uncovered.</li>
    <li>Place a piece of crispy Spam in the center of the rice, then drizzle some of the soy sauce mixture over it.</li>
    <li>Roll the musubi tightly, using the sushi rolling mat. Moisten the exposed nori to seal the roll.</li>
    <li>Repeat for the remaining ingredients.</li>
    <li>Slice each musubi into bite-sized pieces and sprinkle with sesame seeds (if desired).</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Musubi is my favorite recipe because it combines the delicious flavors of crispy Spam, sweet and savory sauce, and perfectly seasoned sushi rice. It's a taste of Hawaii that I can't remind me of the times I was a kid on living on the island of Oahu.</p>
